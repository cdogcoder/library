# library

Hey everyone! This is my first project for the first JavaScript course following Foundations for TOP. In this project, I will be creating a digital library/book catalog using JavaScript objects. Additionally, I will be trying to touch base with some older concepts that I have not tried to implement with my designs yet, such as HTML tables, CSS custom properties, and positioning elements with CSS. With that said, I hope you all liked this project and thank you for viewing this repo!
